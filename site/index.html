  <h1>A quick history of my site</h1>
  <p>Photos from various parts of my site. The good, the bad, and the ugly.</p>
  <p>NOTE: none of the images have alt text at the moment! sorry!!</p>

  <h2>2025</h2>
  <h3>the Fish Phase</h3>
  <p>My current site! One pager, darkmode, and just everything listed out. Somewhat inspired by websites of researchers, where all their papers are listed in one LOOOONG line. Also heavily inspired by a coder from Seattle who had a really cool site! I have to find them again and credit them.</p>

  <h3>the minimalist Phase</h3>
  <p>One pager with plenty of space between sections. Had a dynamic(-ish?) projects section that took the information from a JavaScript object with JSON formatting. Unfortunately I don't have many images from this time at the moment. Could go back and download the code as it was during this phase, as it's available in the Git history.</p>

  <h3>the Blue Phase.</h3>
  <p>Rounder, "bubblier" version of my site. Still formatted very similarly to the first version.</p>
